/*Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own:
An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.*/

//tell our app to listen and what port to listen on
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log('server here! listening on', PORT));
